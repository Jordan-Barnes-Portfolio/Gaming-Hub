# Gaming-Hub

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. 

**Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**
The Gaming Hub wanted me to design a multi-platform transition model

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**
Coding the application itself was the most trivial part for me.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**
Understanding the inheritance protocols for each object in code.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
I would redo the template in which I designed the document to better fit my personal thought process

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
I used their direct requests and requirements, you have to make sure you provide the customer a product they asked for

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**
I followed the design documents and UML's created to make sure I was following proper abstraction and class implementation.
